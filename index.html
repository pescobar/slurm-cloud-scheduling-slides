# Slurm cloud scheduling on OpenStack

Or how to dynamically start and stop slurm compute nodes on OpenStack

# sciCOREMed

- Secure IT environment for sensitive data analysis

- Based on OpenStack private cloud

- Projects are isolated from each other for improved security (OpenStack multitenancy)

- Hardware resources for projects:

    - 16 compute nodes 

    - 848 cpus (with multithreading)

    - ~ 4TB ram
    
    - 4 GPUs

# What problem we had?

- When deploying "static" slurm clusters compute nodes allocated in a tenant are not accessible from other tenants.
<br>
<br>
<br>
- Moving compute nodes between tenants requires sysadmin intervention.
<br>
<br>
<br>
- We can easily have idle compute nodes in a tenant while other tenant requires those nodes.

# Possible solutions

.small[
 - Deploy static slurm in a shared tenant where every user from every project has access

   - This is similar to how the regular sciCORE cluster works.

   - Hardware resources in slurm are shared.

   - Access control is done using file system permissions.

   - It's less secure.

   - Not using the fancy features provided by cloud environments ;)

.small[
 - Buy more hardware so every tenant has a static slurm cluster

   - Perfect solution. It's just expensive and less efficient (hardware is idle)
